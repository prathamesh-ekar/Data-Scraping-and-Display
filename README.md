## Data scraping from Book.toScrape.com using Python, storing in a database and displaying data in an HTML table using Bootstrap framework.
**Developed by:** Prathamesh Rajesh Ekar, MCA student, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute. 

## This project contains:
```
1. DataScraping.ipynb - Code for scraping data from www.books.toscrape.com
2. data.csv - The scrapped data in CSV format.
3. data.db - The scrapped data in db format compatible with SQLite.
4. index.php - The code for webpage to display the data table and the JQuery, Bootstrap implementation.
```

The Python code for data scraping uses libraries like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and XML files. The parsed data is stored as a CSV and a .db file to be used in databases of choice. Database used in this case is **MySQL**.
